---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


AboutUs:
This is an activity which shows the about us page of iPredict in which contains the info of the company.
This page is almost completed but there are few bugs visible there. The bugs I have found so far is that
it is not good in landscape mode, text goes out of the box. If the cusor is visible in the textbox then
we cannot scroll to anywhere. User can send feedback but this will loads a mail app, further improvement
is to have just a click and the text is sent. 

BrowsePrediction:
This is an activity that display the info from the JSON file. These info are read from the web under 'MyJSONReader'. 
The Json only gets from the web once which means there are no updates. This need to fix as we need to get the update
every 5 minutes. Other boxes such as 'Sort' and 'All' is not done yet. The search by text at the moment only does a 
simple search such as name of the stock but not complicated search. At the moment reading from web is really slow
because of the large JSON file. Sometimes the app crash when the Internet Connection lost half way, this is important
and need to investigate. 

LoginActivity:
This is an activity that takes in the login info so that it can directs the user to their own portfolio page.
This is however incomplete as I have no database to read the users info from as iPredict is winding down. 
Temporary this page just directs the user to the portfolio page. 

MainActivity:

This is the home page of the app. The tweet button currently does nothing and the phone image may need to
replace to something else. 

myPortfolio:

This is the porfolio page of the user where all info of the user are displayed here. 

searchPrediction:
This is an activity that loads and display the predictions that users selected from the 'BrowsePrediction' page.
Need to add picture next to the stock name according to the design. 

ShowResult:
This page shows the result of the stock selected previously at the 'searchPrediction' page. All the info here are
displayed properly except the graph. 

Signup: 
This page is for the user to sign up.

Install/Run Instruction:
-----------------------

I have wrote the code under the Android Studio. There are three ways that I knew how to run the program:


1. Run the program via the emulator within the app. 

2. Connect the Android phone via USB and ran the program via the connected device. 

3. Run the program by export the APK file and test under the Android phone.


For 1)

- Choose an appropriate emulator to run the program.
- Do note that using the emulator is not like testing on the real device. They tend to be slower and some functions
are not working as expected. 

For 2)

- Ran via USB connection. Instead of emulator, just connect the Android phone and ran.

For 3)

- Export the release version of the app and put it to the phone.
- On the Android phone, just click on the app to proceed the installation process. The app do not require any authentication
nor does it collect any info. The permission it asked is just the Interntet Connection.
