        Established in 2008, iPredict ran as a political prediction market during the eight weeks
        prior to the election that year. It proved more accurate than three quarters of all
        political polls published in the run up to the election, confirming the effectiveness of
        money prediction markets.\n\n Since then, iPredict has accumulated over 4000 traders and
        has launched more than 7000 contracts, covering a wide variety of topics, from monthly gold
        prices, to the discovery of extraterrestrial life. \n\n So, put your money where your mouth
        is and begin trading today!
